  <p>Her finger hurts. Has been for minutes, at this point. She&rsquo;s been tapping the tip of her right index finger nail against her desk. Staring at a screen with words she can clearly read, but cant move on from. Waiting for one of the several reactions shes having to those words to overpower the rest.</p>
<p>It wont be glee, as simple as that would make things. She only knows one type of person capable of that level of cruelty, and its not &ldquo;supervillain&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She won&rsquo;t let it be pity, either. <em>Penny</em> sent her flying through a brick wall last week, and Quinn still has the bruises all over her back to prove it.</p>
<p>There it is! <em>Anger</em>. She can feel it bubbling up, though its intended target has yet to solidify in her mind.</p>
<p>Before it can, her thoughts are momentarily interrupted by a sharp pain shooting from her finger, half way up her arm. She never stopped tapping, did she? Its by no means a new habit. She&rsquo;s done it just about all her life, whenever she got stuck like this. But, it was never so much of an issue —so painful— before.</p>
<p><em>tap</em>.</p>
<p>Before, when her nails were short.</p>
<p><em>tap</em>.</p>
<p>Before, when she hadn&rsquo;t yet put decided how to put her powers to use.</p>
<p><em>tap</em>.</p>
<p>Before, when she was–</p>
<p>The tapping stops, but her brow furrows and the frown she&rsquo;d been maintaining deepens. &ldquo;Nope&rdquo; she says to herself, &ldquo;Not healthy, Quinn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a supervillain so good at getting into other people&rsquo;s heads, she&rsquo;s way better at getting into her own.</p>
<p>Quinn leans her chair on its back two legs, looks up at the ceiling, and takes a deep breath. Anger. She&rsquo;s definitely angry, but at who? Penny, or the bastards slowly killing her? The girl had been a near constant thorn in her side for months, and although she would never admit it, over time Quinn&rsquo;s feelings towards her nemesis had grown from mere annoyance to bordering on obsession. Penny was hers to defeat. <em>hers</em>, not some fucking doctor too far up his own ass to provide proper care.</p>
<p>And then in an instant, her anger turns to revulsion. At this point, all Quinn would have to do is sit back and watch, and Penny would wither away all on her own. She had gone searching for a weakness. something to bring her enemy low, but this? It was sickening. Penny is supposed to be graceful, freakishly strong, —even compared to most &ldquo;super&rdquo; folk, but especially compared to Quinn— and an ideal opponent for Quinn to prove herself against. No one will take this from her. Not a doctor, Not another villain, and certainly not Penny herself.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s made up her mind, mostly: things cannot remain as they are. If Quinn has to, she&rsquo;ll drag Penny kicking and screaming into a state worth defeating her in. Although, its not like she can just show up at Penny&rsquo;s apartment and- wait, couldn&rsquo;t she? Quinn knows where Penny lives now, and its not like she&rsquo;ll be all that likely to attack Quinn when it could put her neighbors —and her lease— at risk.</p>
<p>Satisfied with her plan, Quinn gets up and walks over to the full length mirror at the other end of the room. She looks like shit. She feels like shit too, but that&rsquo;s pretty much her baseline. normally she likes to dress up for her encounters with the hero, but today she isn&rsquo;t sure she has the energy —or enough makeup to cover the dark circles under her eyes— to pull it off. Letting out a sigh, Quinn takes one last look at herself before muttering &ldquo;Guess its a hoodie day.&rdquo;, and turns to gather her things.</p>
<p>She throws the first hoodie she sees over the faded graphic t-shirt she has on, and moves over to the little zippered travel pouch she keeps by her bed. she restocks it every few injections, so there&rsquo;s no reason to doubt it has everything she needs. The last thing she does before she&rsquo;s out the door is grab her backpack off the back of the chair she had been sitting in earlier, and throws the pouch inside.</p>
