      <description>&lt;p&gt;Her finger hurts. Has been for minutes, at this point. She&amp;rsquo;s been tapping the tip of her right index finger nail against her desk. Staring at a screen with words she can clearly read, but cant move on from. Waiting for one of the several reactions shes having to those words to overpower the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wont be glee, as simple as that would make things. She only knows one type of person capable of that level of cruelty, and its not &amp;ldquo;supervillain&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
